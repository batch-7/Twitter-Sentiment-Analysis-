                                                   Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
   
This project addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in twitter, that is classifying tweets according to the sentiment expressed in them. Due to large amount of usage we hope to achieve a reflection of public sentiment by analyzing the sentiments expressed in the tweets. Analyzing the public sentiment is important for many applications such as firms trying to find out the response of their products in the market. The aim of this project is to develop a functional classifier for accurate and automatic sentiment classification of an unknown tweet stream.

Advantages:
->Proposed system will gives you the freedom to choose the data of any topic.
->It gives you the impact the results and statistics will have on the respective field.
->Proposed system  allows retrieval of data based on the query entered by the user.
->Proposed system will provide accurate feature selection. 

Existing system:
The Existing work mainly focuses on classifying user into binary sentiment(i.e positive, negative) and they do not go further in mining user sentiment.
The Existing approaches mainly leverage product category information or  tag information to study the interpersonal influence.
User reviews can provide us ideas in mining interpersonal interference and user preferences.


Task Split-up:

Module 1 and 2: Done by Anitha Rajam.M(15CSA06)
           
           Datasets
           Data Cleaning
•	Collecting Datasets from Twitter.
•	Importing Datasets into Python.
•	Packages used for python languages are tweepy, textblob and NLTK(Natural Language Tool Kit.
•	For collected datasets we had performed data cleaning and analysed the total amount of tweets.

           
Module 3: Done by Atchaya.S(15CSA10)
          
          Naive Bayes Algorithm
In machine learning, Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
                  
                    P(h|d) = (P(d|h) * P(h)) / P(d) 

•	In Naïve Baye’s first we retrieved our datasets,  though by using cross validation we had done training and testing. All these datas are connected with Naïve.
•	Through pie chart and graph we had shown the difference between Android and Apple

   
Module 4 and 5:Done by Dheekshitha.D(15CSA15)

           Support Vector Algorithm
           Prediction and Accuracy
Support vector machine (SVM) solves the traditional text categorization problem effectively; generally outperforming Naïve Bayes as it supports the concept of maximum margin. 
The idea of SVM is to determine a boundary or boundaries that separate distinct clusters or groups of data. SVM performs this task constructing a set of points and separating those points using mathematical formulas.

•	The same steps had been followed for Support vector algorithm
•	Finally the accuracy for both algorithms are equal with the difference in timings .Hence the prediction shows that the positive comments for iphone is more then Android.
